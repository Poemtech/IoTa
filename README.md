# IoTa
The POEM Technology IoTa: the complete cellular IoT hardware development platform
The IoTa is an open-source cellular developer board featuring the ublox SARA-R410 modem, an ARM Cortex-M0+ and an ARM Cortex-M4.
The IoTa dual processor design frees up the designer to develop code on the final hardware without having to design in a host processor. Code development can take advantage of the Arduino IDE interface for agile project completion.
