Create Package
--------------
To create a package, run the Create-ArduinoPackage.ps1 -Version <version> from Powershell. Change to the directory
where Create-ArduinoPackage.ps1 is before running as the path defaults are based off of that location.

Deploy Package
--------------
Package hosting on corp site can be managed via SiteGround by copying the contents of the "arduino_integration" folder to the corp site folder
under "/poemtechnology.com/public_html/downloads/iota/arduino_integration".

The contents of the ZIP file are the files/folders below the ptdash directory:
	/cores
	/libraries
	/variants
	boards.txt
	platform.txt
	programmers.txt

Changed VM compiler settings to remove deep search for libraries.

To work on the PT Dash library at the same time as using another verison of the library, create a TFS/VS workspace in
the Arduino documents directory (e.g. C:\Users\<usernmae>\Documents\Arduino\hardware\ptdash-user-firmware-working) and
get and work in that directory. Note: Be sure to select the correct PT Dash version (i.e. look for your working forlder)
before bulding a test harness. Also, the name matters. Make sure it starts with the boards name.

There are name collisions between boards that have the same name. So, The POEM Technology Dash is called the "ptdash" and
the working (i.e. development) version is called "ptdashdev". This mainly impacts the boards.txt file and requires that any
item with the name "ptdashdev" needs to be renamed to "ptdash" as part of the packaging process. Also, a working version of
the PTDash board needs to be installed in order for the programmers to be found by the development environment (as of 
2020-02-10).

PS replacement magic for baords.txt: PS> Get-Content boards.txt | Select-String ptdashdev | % { $_.Line.replace("dev", "").replace("DEV", "").replace("Dev", "") }
